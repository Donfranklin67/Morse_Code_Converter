# Morse Code Converter Project

This project provides a simple Morse code converter that can be used both with a user interface (UI) and in the terminal. It allows you to convert text to Morse code.

## Getting Started

To use the Morse code converter, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project from the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.

### Running the Converter

There are two ways to run the Morse code converter:

#### User Interface (UI)

To run the converter with the user interface, use the `ui.py` script:

```bash
python ui.py
```
This will open a graphical user interface where you can enter text and convert it to Morse code.

#### Terminal

To run the converter in the terminal, use the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```
This will allow you to convert text to Morse code using the command line.

### Usage

When using the UI (with ui.py), simply type the text you want to convert in the input field and click the "Encode" button.

When using the terminal (with main.py), follow the on-screen prompts to enter the text you want to convert and choose the conversion direction.
